# Plan Swarm Command

Execute a plan file using parallel worker agents. **Requires a plan file.** All workers complete → done.

**Note:** Loop and swarm are interchangeable - swarm is just faster when tasks can run in parallel. Both enforce exit criteria and sync state.

Uses Claude Code's built-in Task Management System for dependency tracking and visual progress (`ctrl+t`).

## Supported Plan Types

This command works with plans from:
- `/plan-creator` - Implementation plans
- `/bug-plan-creator` - Bug fix plans
- `/code-quality-plan-creator` - LSP-powered quality plans

## Arguments

- `<plan_path>` (required): Path to the plan file
- `--workers N` (optional): Override worker count (default: auto-detected from task graph)
- `--model MODEL` (optional): Model for workers: haiku, sonnet, opus (default: sonnet)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Plan (Only)

Read the plan file and extract tasks. **DO NOT read other files, grep, or explore the codebase** - just parse the plan:
1. **Files to Edit** - existing files that need modification
2. **Files to Create** - new files to create
3. **Implementation Plan** - per-file implementation instructions
4. **Requirements** - acceptance criteria
5. **Exit Criteria** - verification script and success conditions

### Step 2: Create Task Graph

For each work item, create a task with dependencies:

```json
TaskCreate({
  "subject": "Implement auth middleware",
  "description": "Full implementation details from plan - self-contained",
  "activeForm": "Implementing auth middleware"
})
```

Set dependencies based on plan structure:

```json
TaskUpdate({
  "taskId": "2",
  "addBlockedBy": ["1"]
})
```

**Task types:**
- File edits/creates → one task per file
- Major requirements → one task each
- Exit criteria verification → final task, blocked by all others

### Step 3: Queue-Based Execution

Use `--workers N` to limit concurrent agents (default: 3). This is a **queue**, not a pool:

1. Get all ready tasks (pending, unblocked)
2. Spawn up to N agents for the first N ready tasks (1 task per agent)
3. Each agent executes ONE task then exits
4. As agents complete, spawn new agents for next ready tasks
5. Continue until all tasks done

**Spawn agents in a single message for parallelism:**

```json
Task({
  "description": "Task-1 executor",
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "run_in_background": true,
  "prompt": "Execute this ONE task then exit:

Task ID: 1
Subject: Implement auth middleware
Description: <full details from plan>

Steps:
1. TaskUpdate - claim: status: in_progress
2. Execute the task
3. TaskUpdate - status: completed
4. Exit immediately"
})
```

### Step 4: Monitor and Refill Queue

Loop until all tasks complete:

1. Wait for any agent to finish (TaskOutput with block: false to poll)
2. Check TaskList for newly unblocked ready tasks
3. Spawn new agents up to the worker limit
4. Repeat

### Step 5: Report Completion

Say **"Swarm complete"** when all tasks finished.

## Visual Progress

Press `ctrl+t` to see task progress:
```
Tasks (2 done, 2 in progress, 3 open)
■ #3 Implement auth (Worker-1)
■ #4 Add routes (Worker-2)
□ #5 Integration tests > blocked by #3, #4
```

## Context Recovery

If context compacts:
1. Call TaskList to see all tasks and their status
2. Call TaskOutput on workers for their reports
3. Check what remains

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Plan file not found | Report error and exit |
| Worker fails mid-task | Other workers continue; task stays in_progress |
| All tasks blocked | Circular dependency - review task graph |

## Stopping

- Workers self-terminate when no work remains
- Use `/cancel-swarm` to halt early

## Example Usage

```bash
/plan-swarm .claude/plans/add-user-auth.md              # Auto-detects workers
/plan-swarm .claude/plans/refactor.md --workers 5       # Override: force 5 workers
/plan-swarm .claude/plans/docs.md --model haiku         # Cheaper workers, auto count
```
